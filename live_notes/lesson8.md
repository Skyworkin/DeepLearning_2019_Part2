Welcome to the course, for those of you who come every year, its a very different course.

### What we will do

- Implement fastai library from foundations (from scratch). 
- Read and implement papers
- Implementing much of pytorch
- Going deeper into applications that are not fully-baked in yet
    - seq2seq
    - attention
    - Transformer

- Use JIT / CUDA
- Last 2 lessons, implementing some lessons in Swift
- Part 1 was more practical, learn a technique and use it
- So whats this classes approach? We will teach you the tools to implement papers, experiment with them, and try them out for yourselves
- We used to call part 2 cutting edge, but now the cutting edge is now the engineering part of deep learning. The most effective people are the ones who can successfully build and deploy models

- Part 1 was topdown, saw how deep learning is used in practice, and how to use it, and how to get results
- Part 2 will be bottom up: lets you see the connections between the various things. then you can customize your algo for your own problem, doing the things you need it to do.

- Chris Lattner: build LLVM, built the default compiler C++ clang. And he built Swift, and is now focusing on deep learning
- None of the previous languages were designed for the multi-processor operations, designed by a compiler specialists
